     <H2>My personal goals</H2>

        <h3>1.Go to a yoga club</h3>
            <p>The overall consensus is that yoga has many positive effects on mental health that go beyond the effects of other low- to-medium-impact physical activity.
            Practicing yoga emphasizes the connection between our minds and our bodies, and encourages you to use both at the same time.
            although yoga may seem like a relatively mild form of exercise, regular yoga practice can result in the same health benefits as many other types of exercise but with less of an impact on joints and <b>more relaxation</b>!

         <h3>2.Find a good work/life balance</h3>
            <P>In the last years, I worked very hard during my high school degree. Alos I felt some fatigue in recent months. Maybe it’s due to the weather, but hey, I also feel the need to slow down a bit and breathe.
                <h4>How to reach the goal:</h4>
                 <ul>
                   <li>Plan my schedule</li>
                   <li>Oragnise my time</li>
                 </ul>
         <h3>3.Read more books</h3>
             <p>Even if a book interests me, I have a hard time sitting down and putting my brain on hold for a few hours to read.For me, reading does not go fast enough. I wish I could read more quickly, be more productive, anything other than reading. It’s too slow. <br> of my goals this year is to be able to take time for myself. Reading more is a way to do it, to stop for a moment life that goes too fast!</p>
            
             <h4>How to reach the goal:</h4>
                     <ul>
                         <li>Even though I want to read self-help books, I think it’s a little too much for someone who is slowly starting to read again. So I’m going to read love stories to start, accessible and captivating novels!</li>
                         <li>Listen to audiobooks on <i><b>
                             <a href="https://www.spotify.com/bg/">Spotify</a></b></i> and <i><b><a href="https://www.audible.co.uk/ep/row?source_code=M2M30DFT1BK12108281801TF&gclid=CjwKCAjw3c_tBRA4EiwAICs8Cv5MwYim9gbzeFhYab-yQA8ugvuD7AeHSzdVVmvvoKqktaZTX9TGwRoC-OMQAvD_BwE">Audible</a></b></i></li>
