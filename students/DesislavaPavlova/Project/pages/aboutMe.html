	<p>As an avid reader, I'm always in a search for more books. I prefer Fantasy, Sci-fi, Mystery, Romance but will pretty much read anything if it sounds at least a bit interesting(no, you won't see me read Labor Law Codexes if I didn't have to). I love happy endings in my books too. If you see me sitting somewhere with a book - interupt me at your own risk.</p>
	<h3>Pets</h3>
	<p>Whhhaaaaaattttt? Pets? Who? <em>Me?</em> I can kill a cactus by forgetting to water it. Does that sound like someone who should be getting a pet?</p>
