	<p>As an avid reader, I'm always in a search for more books. I prefer Fantasy, Sci-fi, Mystery, Romance but will pretty much read anything if it sounds at least a bit interesting(no, you won't see me read Labor Law Codexes if I didn't have to). I love happy endings in my books too. If you see me sitting somewhere with a book - interupt me at your own risk.</p>
	<h3>Pets</h3>
	<p>Whhhaaaaaattttt? Pets? Who? <em>Me?</em> I can kill a cactus by forgetting to water it. Does that sound like someone who should be getting a pet?</p>
	<h3>What I'm expecting from the HTML\CSS\JS course?</h3>
	<p>Will leave that for when I have a better idea myself.</p>
	<h3>What project do I want to make till the end of the course?</h3>
	<p>A bookworm one. I want to make myself a site for book reviews. Would love to have a place to put in my favorite youtube vids too.</p>
	<h3>Where did I found out about the course from?</h3>
	<p>From someone named Google. Have you met him? He is a really nice guy.</p>
