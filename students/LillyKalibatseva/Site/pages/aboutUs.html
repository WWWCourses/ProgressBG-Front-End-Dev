				<span>Hi there,</span>
				<span>My name is Marco. </span>
				I was born near the most magic city in the world: Venice. I moved to Bulgaria many years ago . I'm a poet and a writer. For the past ten years I have been taken care of a blog in which I narrate about Italy and the rest of the world. I translate from Bulgarian to Italian.

				<span class="qualification">Qualifications & Experience</span>
				I obtained teaching certification/qualification from the Foreigners University of Perugia. I have attended special updating courses for teachers of Italian language abroad at the Italian Institute of Culture in Sofia,taught by the University for Foreigners of Perugia's professors,which specialize in teaching Italian language to foreigners. I learned English by attending English courses of study ,also studied with private tutors and participated in English seminars language. I taught in a linguistic center, at a private high school and at the Dante Alighieri Society – Società Dante Alighieri - located in Sofia, the Bulgarian capital.
				Teaching Approach.
			</p>
			<p class="paragraph3 text">
				I customize lesson accordingly to the interests and abilities of each student, starting from a well-established methodology but flexible at the same time so to fit each and every of their individual needs.
			</p>
			<p class="paragraph3 text">
				Assign home work , ( as an example: grammar exercises and short essay) . During the lesson I obtain their attention by stimulating them with anecdotes, stories, getting them interested mainly to music, cinema and Italian cuisine. ( Everybody loves pizza...). The communicative relationship with the student is very important to me.
			</p>
			<p class="paragraph4 text">
				Following them step by step, one lesson after another while increasing their Italian language vocabulary , exercising their ability to formulate more complex sentences as time goes by.
				paying particular attention to pronunciation, trying to mitigate as far as possible their native Countries accents.
			</p>
			<p class="paragraph5 text">
				Bringing their attention during the oral and/or written classes to double letters and accents.
				I point out the Italian idiomatic dioms, proverbs, combining the pure language to the everyday people's culture. I constantly use media such as videos,texts, newspaper articles, so to have the students become always more interested and eager to know by keep on asking questions.
				I believe in a relationship of equality between the student and the teacher, don't matter what the time zone may be.
