	<h1 class="heading">COVER LETTER</h1>
		<p>Web design and front-end development have been an interesting topic for me for a long time, although I postponed the serious study of this matter. <br> I have now decided that the time has come. That's why I did research on the internet and set up several schools. I have seen online lectures, I have <br> also learned about the curriculum. About this I also consulted with a friend of mine who used to work in this field. The <span class="italic">Progress</span> program has proven to be the most balanced <br> one covering the minimum for a solid foundation on which to continue my development.</p>
