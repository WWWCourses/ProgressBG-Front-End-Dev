<h1>Fashion Aphorisms by Coco Chanel</h1>
      <p class="bluebackground">It is always better to be slightly undressed. </p>
      <p>Fashion is what goes out of fashion. </p>
      <p class="bluebackground" >I don`t know why women want any of the things men have when one the things that women have is men. </p>
      <p>All men are children, and if understand that, a woman understands everything. </p>
      <p class="bluebackground">Dress shabbily, they notice the dress. Dress impeccably, they notice the woman. </p>
      <p>There are people who have money and people who are rich. </p>
      <p class="bluebackground">Elegance is refusal. </p>
      <p>Success is often achieved by those who don`t know that failure is inevitable. </p>
      <p class="bluebackground">Nature gives you the face you have at twenty; it is up to you to merit the face you have at fifty. </p>
      <p>A woman has the age she deserves. </p>
      <p class="bluebackground">It is the unseen, unforgettable, ultimate accessory of fashion that heralds your arrival and prolongs your departure. </p>
      <p>Nature gives you the face you have at twenty. Life shapes the face you have at thirty. But at fifty you get the face you deserve. </p>
      <p class="bluebackground">Fashion is made to become unfashionable. </p>
      <p>Elegance does not consist in putting on a new dress. </p>
      <p class="bluebackground">Jump out the window if you are the object of passion. Flee it if you feel it. Passion goes, boredom remains. </p>
      <p>Fashion is architecture: it is a matter of proportions. </p>
      <p class="bluebackground">Fashion is not something that exists in dresses only. Fashion is in the sky, in the street, fashion has to do with ideas, the way we live, what is happening. </p>
      <p>The best color in the whole world is the one that looks good on you! </p>
      <p class="bluebackground">Fashion fades, only style remains the same. </p>
      <p>A woman who doesn`t wear perfume has no future. </p>
