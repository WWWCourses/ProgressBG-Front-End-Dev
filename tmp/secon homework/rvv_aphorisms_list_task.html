			<li class="light"> Herman Cain - “Success is not the key to happiness. Happiness is the key to success.”</li>
			<li class="dark">David Bly - “Striving for success without hard work is like trying to harvest where you haven’t planted.”</li>
			<li class="light">Confuciu - “If you want to change the world, first change your heart.”</li>
			<li class="dark">Aristotle - “Excellence is not a singular act, but a habit. You are what you repeatedly do.”</li>
			<li class="light">Thich Nhat Hanh - “The present moment is the only moment available to us and it is the door to all moments.”</li>
			<li class="dark">Albert Einstein - “If A equals success, then the formula is A equals X plus Y and Z, with X being work, Y play, and Z keeping your mouth shut.”</li>
			<li class="light">Stanley Tang - “Success comes down to hard work plus passion, over time.”</li>
			<li class="dark">Adam Horwitz - “The hardest part about being an entrepreneur is that you’ll fail ten times for every success.”</li>
			<li class="light">Thomas J. Watson - “Would you like me to give you a formula for success? It’s quite simple, really. Double your rate of failure. You are thinking of failure as the enemy of success. But it isn’t at all. You can be discouraged by failure or you can learn from it. So go ahead and make mistakes. Make all you can. Because remember that’s where you will find success.”</li>
			<li class="dark">Michael Konda -  “The fastest way to succeed is to look as if you’re playing by somebody else’s rules, while quietly playing by your own.”</li>
			<li class="light">Kevin Kruse -Life is about making an impact, not making an income.</li>
			<li class="dark">Napoleon Hill - Whatever the mind of man can conceive and believe, it can achieve.</li>
			<li class="light">Albert Einstein - Strive not to be a success, but rather to be of value.</li>
			<li class="dark">James Allen - “For true success ask yourself these four questions: Why? Why not? Why not me? 	Why not now?”</li>
			<li class="light">Arnold H. Glasgow - “Success is simple. Do what’s right, the right way, at the right time.”</	li>
			<li class="dark">Swami Vivekananda - “Take up one idea. Make that one idea your life: think of it, dream of it, live on that idea. Let the brain, muscles, nerves, every part of your body, be full of that idea, and just leave every other idea alone. This is the way to success.”</li>
			<li class="light">Steve Jobs - “Simple can be harder than complex: You have to work hard to get your thinking 	clean to make it simple. But it’s worth it in the end because once you get there, you can move mountains.”</li>
			<li class="dark">Carrie Fisher - “There is no point at which you can say, “Well, I’m successful now. I might as well take a nap.”</li>
